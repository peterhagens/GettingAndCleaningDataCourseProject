# GettingAndCleaningDataCourseProject
Course Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course on Coursera

This reposity contains the R script called run_analysis.R that does the following (the 5 parts of the assignment):

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Detailed information of the working of the script is included in the comments within the script. 

## Instructions
* This scripts works when the Samsung data set folder is set as your working directory.
* Simply run the script run_analysis.R
* The result is saved as a table file "tidyset.txt", without row names.
